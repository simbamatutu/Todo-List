=======================================To-do List=====================================

The program is a To-do list which makes use of the Linked list data structure.
A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate 
object. Each element (which is each To-do entry) of a list is comprising of two
items - the data(*to-do) and a reference to the next node(*link). The last node
has a reference to null. The entry point into a linked list is called the head of
the list.

Through the use of number selections, the user can perform various functionalities.
These include to ability to create a new list, add new entries, delete any entry at 
random and lastly refresh the entire list thus deleting the entire list.

The user has to use number selections to be able to select their desired option in the 
program.
The program allows the user to refresh the list. This option will result in the entire 
to-do list being deleted and the user will receive a warning before performing the 
refresh function.
The user has the ability to delete any entry from the list.The user will only have to
select the entry they wish to delete and it will be deleted. 

This program makes use of the advantages of the linked list. A linked list is Dynamic
Data Structure so it can grow and shrink at runtime by allocating and deallocating 
memory. So there is no need for the user to give the initial size of their To-do 
list. 
The Linked list allows for Insertion and deletion of nodes at random therefore the user
has the ability to insert and delete entries anywhere. Unlike in an array where the 
user will have to shift elements after deleting or inserting a single element, In this 
To-do list there is no need to shift elements after insertion or deletion of an element. 
In linked list there just have to update the address present in next pointer of a
node.
A linked list saves time as size of linked list can increase or decrease at runtime so
there is no memory wastage. In case of array there is lot of memory wastage, like if we
declare an array of size 10 and store only 6 elements in it then space of 4 elements 
are wasted. There is no such problem in the To-do List as memory is allocated only 
when required.
